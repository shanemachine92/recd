As a user, I can upload recommendations and recommend specific fics to specifc users. I can favorite the best of the best from Rec'd and I can sort and search fics.

I can drop in a link to a fic and the 'new recommendations' form pulls in data and maps to the corresponding fields via api.

As a user, Rec'd has a recommendation engine component that suggests fics for me.

As an admin, I can create new pages as new fandoms are added to the archive. All admin functions are controlled by a dashoboard.
