# Rec'd

An app for recommending high-quality fanfiction from the Dragon Age Fandom to other fans. Spend less time looking for great fic to read and more time reading well-vetted, recommended fic. 

All fics included are at least 5000 words long, feature a non-male lead, and exclude crack!fic elements.

App curators can add new fic recommendations to the site and users can link out to and review recommendations.
